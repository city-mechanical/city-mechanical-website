# SAMPLE DATA

This folder strictly contains sample data which is constucted in a similar way to the final product's data structre.  This data is used as a way to develop the site to be capable for a headless cms, without implementing the backend requirements.

Once frontend development is fully designed, and completed.  Then, the WordPress backend endpoints will be built out to fit the needs of this application.

This folder is structred in a way to simulate GET requests. (i.e. the folder /footer contains the data which will be returned when the footer is requested, etc.)
